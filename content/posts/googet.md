# What is Googet?

From Googet's [readme](https://github.com/google/googet/blob/master/README.md#googet):

> GooGet (Googet's Obviously Only a Goofy Experimental Title) is a modular package repository solution primarily designed for Windows.

> GooGet is shipped with the official Google Cloud Platform Windows images and is used to maintain the guest environment.

> This is not an official Google product.

Googet tackles the same problem set as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and [Gorilla](https://github.com/1dustindavis/gorilla)
